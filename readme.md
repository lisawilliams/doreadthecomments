#Do Read The Comments

A collection of resources, thoughts, essays and papers in response to Don't Read The Comments. 

* Don't Read The Comments' twitter account, [@AvoidComments](https://twitter.com/avoidcomments). *It's notable that the account shut down in December of 2014*

[Don't Read The Comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dont-read-the-comments/nlhmhpppjnlbdfgebinkgjiljipnejbe?hl=en"), a mobile app that removes the comments from web pages you look at on your phone.


*It has become the way of the Internet. We have come to understand that the comments section is not unlike the Internet’s own septic system: it sits below every post and video and article, collecting all the trash and shit and evil clowns that have been cast down from above. It’s positively dystopian. Up above are the elites, zipping about on their information superhighway, while below, the underpass has some kind of violent hobo fight club playing out again and again.*

*Fix your communities. Stop allowing and excusing destructive and pointless conversations to be the fuel for your business. Advertisers, hold sites accountable if your advertising appears next to this hateful stuff. Take accountability for this medium so we can save it from the vilification that it still faces in our culture.*

*Because if your website is full of assholes, it's your fault. And if you have the power to fix it and don't do something about it, you're one of them.*
