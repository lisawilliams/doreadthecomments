* Don't Read The Comments' twitter account, [@AvoidComments](https://twitter.com/avoidcomments). *It's notable that the account shut down in December of 2014*

* [Don't Read The Comments](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dont-read-the-comments/nlhmhpppjnlbdfgebinkgjiljipnejbe?hl=en"), a Chrome app that removes the comments from web pages.

* [NPR Plays April Fools' Joke On People Who Don't Read](http://gawker.com/npr-pulled-a-brilliant-april-fools-prank-on-people-who-1557745710), Gawker's note on NPR's April Fools' prank demonstrating that many people don't read the article before they comment.  Notable: NPR uses Facebook comments.  Many people feel that "real identities" will solve the problem of venom in online commenting.


*It has become the way of the Internet. We have come to understand that the comments section is not unlike the Internet’s own septic system: it sits below every post and video and article, collecting all the trash and shit and evil clowns that have been cast down from above. It’s positively dystopian. Up above are the elites, zipping about on their information superhighway, while below, the underpass has some kind of violent hobo fight club playing out again and again.*

*Fix your communities. Stop allowing and excusing destructive and pointless conversations to be the fuel for your business. Advertisers, hold sites accountable if your advertising appears next to this hateful stuff. Take accountability for this medium so we can save it from the vilification that it still faces in our culture.*

*Because if your website is full of assholes, it's your fault. And if you have the power to fix it and don't do something about it, you're one of them.*

*I admit it’s depressing for one who’s invested almost her entire career in online community to throw in the towel on it in this way. I want it to be better. But it’s just not. As a colleague once observed, “I just can’t take another letter from Angry Bad Divorce Guy.” And my reading the comments – even participating in the conversation – won’t change that.*

*There is also an increasingly accepted fallacy, a cousin to “don’t read the comments”, if you will, that it’s just “how the Internet is.” That abuse against historically marginalized groups should be accepted, because, hey, everybody is abused equally here (a categorically untrue assessment, but there are many who genuinely believe it.) That in order to earn the right to use the internet one must first bathe in the fires of sexism, racism, or misogyny and come out unscathed, because “that’s how the Internet is” and to brave the Internet is to implicitly accept this agreement. To challenge it is to deny the Internet’s Internet-ness, its infallible status quo.*

*...comment sections shouldn’t be the rule, but they should be a carefully managed gift to readers on an article-by-article basis. That means readers should be thankful they’re allowed to comment directly on the site – not feel infringed when it’s not there.*

*Tung said there are a couple of specific challenges when it comes to analyzing these kinds of discussions. For one thing, comments are often presented in a JavaScript widget, so it’s not as straightforward as pulling the text — it requires “a bunch of visual analysis,” he said. For another, discussions often use more casual, colloquial, and emoji-heavy English, so Diffbot needed to develop “a more specialized language model.”*

*One of the reasons I launched the Discourse project was due to the utter lack of understanding of how you build software to help online discussion communities moderate themselves. Their survival depends on it.*

* Jeff has VC funding to create what he hopes will be "the Wordpress of forums," a project called [Discourse/Civilized Discourse Kit](http://blog.codinghorror.com/civilized-discourse-construction-kit/)  The source code is [here on Github](https://github.com/discourse/discourse).  You can see Discourse forums at BoingBoing.  Here's a [Discourse forum for Discourse users on Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/).

*Respondents who saw comments evaluated the article as being of lower quality—an 8 percent difference. In other words, authors are judged not just by what they write, but by how people respond.*

*Comments can be bad for science. That's why, here at PopularScience.com, we're shutting them off.*

*I had expected to see comments about some of the kids being too young. That would be a natural reaction. An honest one. I’m sure each parent had thought long and hard about letting their child participate. I know my husband and I did. But what I didn’t expect to see was such intolerance. Such ignorance. And such vicious racism. Even now, in 2015, seeing the “N” word infuriates me but directed at my child and me? In all caps? Only to be followed by how other races are superior to my own. With the final insult reading something like, “Why are the dark kids the only ones without fathers? Anyone else noticing a trend?” It was too much.*

*Marginalized groups—in this case, undocumented immigrant minors—can be placed into categories that devalue and dehumanize them. Such dehumanization can justify or encourage anything from the restriction of life-saving resources to the outright killing of those no longer seen as valuable to human society. The great danger in these comments, then, is not only that they homogenize undocumented minors and undocumented immigrants, but that they dehumanize them as well. As a rhetoric of uprooting “pests” becomes more acceptable, the lives of undocumented immigrants are devalued—be it for race, ethnicity, immigration status, or socioeconomic status—and militarized “solutions” to both their migration and existence become more palatable and “logical.”*

*It’s strange to be watching some of the most groundbreaking, innovative technology in the world, while your peripheral vision is populated by racist, misogynist garbage-speak...The presenters—at least the male presenters—were mocked and ridiculed for their stupid, stupid ideas.*

*But something different happened every time a woman took the stage.*

*The mean comments got a little meaner, the dark ones a little darker, and everything became entirely unfocused on the subject at hand. Suddenly, people were talking about the presenter’s body and clothing. Or worse. The women who spoke at length at Google I/O—namely, VP of Engineering for Maps Jen Fitzpatrick and Google Play Product Manager Ellie Powers—were ridiculed for their appearances, or “praised” to lengths that definitely equate to harassment.*

### Thoughts about Comments

What if you could choose between different styles of interaction for each topic or story?

* Comments throughout, the way Medium does it?
* Some conversations and stories do not end.  What about forum/group-like forms of engagement?
* What about specific asks, rather than a general, blank comment box?
* Standard comments (responsive, below, general) 
* One comment per user, character-limited
* No Comments
* No comments unless moderated
* Comments of all sorts automatically close  


### Thoughts about moderation

* Moderation is often thought of as an effort to get rid of "bad" comments and "bad" commenters. 
* Hostile and aggressive commenters are likely to "come in hot," that is, they sign up specifically to post an angry comment.  A great deal of "bad" commenting happens in a user's first ten comments.  What if we had a way to shape early commenting?
* There are a million forms of centralized and distributed moderation.  At some point, a list.  

### Community policies/rules of engagement

Let's collect example policies.

### Why bother?

*Opinion/thought in progress*  

1. Comments are an engine of relevancy.  You cannot have engagement without relevance.  Comments, good, bad, and indifferent, reveal what's relevant to the people viewing that page.  Notably, people comment even when they haven't read a story.  Why?  Because they want to express themselves about something relevant and important *to them.*
2. A community is not "people come to talk to us about stuff we produce."  A community is when people come to your site to talk to *each other.*
